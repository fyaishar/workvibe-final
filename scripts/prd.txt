# Workvibe Flutter Project PRD

## Project Overview
Workvibe is a modern workplace collaboration platform built with Flutter, integrated with a Node.js backend and Firebase Realtime Database. The application focuses on team productivity, task management, and real-time communication.

## Core Features

### 1. User Management & Authentication
- User registration and login using Firebase Authentication
- User profiles with customizable avatars and status (active, away, focusing, inMeeting, offline)
- Session management with secure token handling

### 2. State Management & Data Models
- Implementation using Riverpod for state management
- Core data models:
  - User model with status management
  - Session information tracking
  - Task and project models
  - Team member management
- JSON serialization support using Freezed
- Comprehensive test coverage for all models

### 3. Task Management
- Create, read, update, and delete tasks
- Task properties: title, description, completion status, due date, priority
- Task categorization and filtering
- Real-time task updates using Firebase

### 4. Project Management
- Project creation and team assignment
- Task grouping within projects
- Team member roles and permissions
- Project progress tracking

### 5. Real-time Features
- Live status updates
- Real-time task modifications
- Team member presence indicators
- Instant notifications for task changes
